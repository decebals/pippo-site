[Route]({{ site.coreurl }}/src/main/java/ro/pippo/core/route/Route.java) are URL schema, which describe the interfaces for making requests to your web application. Combining an HTTP request method (a.k.a. HTTP verb) and a path pattern, you define URLs in your application.  
Each route has an associated [RouteHandler]({{ site.coreurl }}/src/main/java/ro/pippo/core/route/RouteHandler.java), which does the job of performing any action in the application and sending the HTTP response.  
Routes are defined using an HTTP verb and a path pattern. Any request to the server that matches a route definition is routed to the associated route handler.

```java
GET("/", new RouteHandler() {

    @Override
    public void handle(RouteContext routeContext) {
        routeContext.send("Hello World");
    }

});

// or more concise using Java 8 lambdas

GET("/", routeContext -> routeContext.send("Hello World"));
```

Routes in Pippo are created using methods named after HTTP verbs. For instance, in the previous example, we created a route to handle GET requests to the root of the website. You have a corresponding method in Application for all commonly used HTTP verbs (__GET__, __POST__, __DELETE__, __HEAD__, __PUT__, __PATCH__, __CONNECT__ and __OPTIONS__). For a basic website, only GET and POST are likely to be used.  
Pippo comes with a "pseudo" verb `ANY` that meant the route applied to any HTTP methods/verbs.
```java
ANY("/example", new CSRFHandler());
```

The route that is defined first takes precedence over other matching routes. So the ordering of routes is crucial to the behavior of an application.

Each defined route has an __urlPattern__.
The route can be static or dynamic:

- `static` ("/", "/hello", "/contacts/1")
- `dynamic`
   - regex ("/.*") 
   - parameterized ("/contact/{id}", "/contact/{id: [0-9]+}")

As you can see, it's easy to create routes with parameters. A parameter is wrapped by curly braces `{name}` and can optionally specify a regular expression.

You can retrieve the path parameter value for a request in type safe mode using:

```java
GET("/contact/{id}", routeContext -> {
    // retrieve some parameters from request
    int id = routeContext.getParameter("id").toInt(0);
    String action = routeContext.getParameter("action").toString("new");

    // render a template using above parameters
    Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<>();
    model.put("id", id);
    model.put("action", action)
    routeContext.render("contact", model);
});
```

If you want to be more rigorous you can use something like:

```java
GET("/contact/{id: [0-9]+}", routeContext -> ... );
```

Pippo comes with some builtin route handlers that can be useful for you:
- `TemplateHandler` (render a template)
- `RedirectHandler` (redirect to another route/url)
- `TrailingSlashHandler` (add or remove the trailing slash to/from path)
- `CSRFHandler` (generates and validates a CSRF token)
- `UrlResourceHandler`
- `ClasspathResourceHandler`
- `PublicResourceHandler`
- `WebjarsResourceHandler`
- `MeteredHandler`, `TimedHandler`, `CountedHandler` (metrics)

and the list can continue.

Now, we will talk a little bit about `TrailingSlashHandler` because is important and the problem that it solves is not so visible.
If we add a route as in the below example
```java
GET("/test", routeContext -> routeContext.send("Test"));
```
and we type `localhost/test/` in browser we will see that the result is 404 (not found) http code.
Of course that `localhost/test` works OK. Explanation for 404 on `localhost/test/` is that we registered a route 
only for `/test` path.
To obtain the same result for both urls (with and without `\` character at end) we will use `TrailingSlashHandler` (as before filter)
```java
// add trailing slash filter
ANY("/.*", new TrailingSlashHandler(false)); // remove trailing slash

// add test route
GET("/test", routeContext -> routeContext.send("Test"));
```
Now, if you type `localhost/test` or `localhost/test/` in browser, the result is the same.

#### Named routes

`Named` routes make referring to routes when generating redirects or URLs more convenient. You may specify a name for a route like so:

```java
GET("/blogs/{year}/{month}/{day}/{title}", routeContext -> routeContext.render("myTemplate")).named("blog");
```

Now, you may use the route's name when generating URLs or redirects:

```java
Map<String, Object> parameters = ...
routeContext.uriFor("blog", parameters);
// or
routeContext.redirect("blog", parameters);
```
#### Content-Type by Suffix

You may optionally specify the response content-type with a URI suffix by appending a special regex pattern to your Route declaration.

The examples below assume you have a `ContentTypeEngine` registered for JSON, XML, and YAML.

```java
// Register a route that optionally respects a content-type suffix
// e.g. /contact/54
//      /contact/54.json
//      /contact/54.xml
//      /contact/54.yaml
GET("/contact/{id: [0-9]+}(\\.(json|xml|yaml))?", routeContext -> routeContext.send(contact));

// Register a route that requires a content-type suffix
// e.g. /contact/54.json
//      /contact/54.xml
//      /contact/54.yaml
GET("/contact/{id: [0-9]+}(\\.(json|xml|yaml))", routeContext -> routeContext.send(contact));

// Register a route that requires a content-type suffix
// e.g. /contact/john.json
//      /contact/john.xml
//      /contact/john.yaml
GET("/contact/{id}(\\.(json|xml|yaml))", routeContext -> routeContext.send(contact));
```

**Note:**

If you specify your parameter <u>without</u> a regex pattern, like the third example (e.g. `{id}`), the value of *id* will include your suffix unless you require the suffix using the pattern in the second example.

#### Route groups

[RouteGroup]({{ site.coreurl }}src/main/java/ro/pippo/core/route/RouteGroup.java) allow you to prefix <code>uriPattern</code>,
across a large number of routes without needing to define this attribute on each individual route.   
Also you can add (route) filters for all routes of the group.

The `RouteGroup` is a concept very import when you are forced to deal with a considerable number of routes in your application.  

The below snippet defines a `UserRoutes` group:

```java
public class UserRoutes extends RouteGroup {

    public UserRoutes() {
        super("/user");

        // BEFORE FILTERS
        addBeforeFilters();

        // CRUD ROUTES
        GET("/{id}", routeContext -> ... ); // retrieve
        POST("/", routeContext -> ... ); // create
        PUT("/{id}", routeContext -> ... ); // update
        DELETE("/{id}", routeContext -> ... ); // delete
    }

}
```

Add the `UserRoutes` group to application:

```java
public class PippoApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    protected void onInit() {
        addRouteGroup(new UserRoutes());
    }

}
```

You can access the routes defined in `UserRoutes` using something like `http://localhost:8338/user/1` (retrieve the user with _id_ equals with 1).

Pippo has support for __NESTED GROUPS__.  
The idea is that you can create completely decoupled routes groups. Using nested routes groups you can create a nice modular application.

```java
public class DemoApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    protected void onInit() {
        addRouteGroup(new AdminRoutes());
    }

}

public class AdminRoutes extends RouteGroup {

    public AdminRoutes() {
        super("/admin");

        // BEFORE FILTERS
        addBeforeFilters();

        // ROUTES
        addRoutes();

        // GROUPS
        addRouteGroup(new UserRoutes());
        addRouteGroup(new CustomerRoutes());
    }

}
```

In above snippet I added (in DemoApplication) `AdminRoutes` as route group which contains `UserRoutes` and `CustomerRoutes` as child routes groups.   
I don't need to know when I create a RouteGroup where the group will be mount. For example I can have a modular web application where each plugin comes with own independent routes (user management -> `UserRoutes`, customer management -> `CustomerRoutes`).  
  
You can see a more complex example in [Matilda](https://github.com/decebals/matilda/blob/master/src/main/java/ro/fortsoft/matilda/PippoApplication.java#L108) (a real life application built with Pippo).
